On R2, create a named standard access list called:

    Permit the host at IP address 192.168.10.10.
    Use the name PERMIT-ADMIN.
    After configuration, return to global configuration mode.

R2(config)#ip access-list standard PERMIT-ADMIN

R2(config-std-nacl)#permit 192.168.10.10

R2(config-std-nacl)#exit

Enhance the login process using the following instructions:

    Disable login for 15 seconds if more than 5 failed logins are attempted within 60 seconds.
    The host specified in the PERMIT-ADMIN ACL should never be denied login access.
    Specify a login delay of 10 seconds between failed login attempts.
    Generate Syslog messages for successful login attempts.
    Generate Syslog messages for failed login attempts.
    After configuration, exit global configuration mode.

R2(config)#login block-for 15 attempts 5 within 60

R2(config)#login quiet-mode access-class PERMIT-ADMIN

R2(config)#login delay 10

R2(config)#login on-success log

R2(config)#login on-failure log

R2(config)#exit
